<h1>Do you suffer from <strong>Coulrophobia?</strong> (Fear of Clowns)</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>Why are people afraid of <strong>clowns</strong> and how do people develop <strong>Coulrophobia?</strong></h3>
  <p><em>10/15/24 by <a href="mailto:tyler200483@student-schoolsofwestfield.org">Tyler</a></em></p>
  <p>A lot of people have a fear of clowns and can cause them to have anxiety or may feel nausea and their heart will start racing the minute they are faced with the visual representation of a clown, either from a real clown in front of them or even just a picture.</p>
  <p>Coulrophobia is often caused by a negative experience from one’s childhood that involved a clown of some sort. Even if you do not have any fear of clowns at the time, when you grow up you may just develop one.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>What about clowns is so scary to people?</h3>
  <p>Clowns wear makeup and other face prosthetics that alter their appearance in order to either make kids laugh at a birthday party or scare people usually during halloween. This aspect of clowns tends to be what leads to people’s hatred or fear towards clowns and what makes them seem as a direct threat.</p>
  <p>I am a fan of horror movies, and a lot of big horror and thriller movies are based on clowns. For people with Coulrophobia this of course would be a big no no, and I feel that movies like 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7no56Zw1e20"><em>IT</em></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY"><em>The Joker</em></a> have increased the number of people with this fear and made matters worse for people that had it before those movies came out.</p>

    <h3>5 Reasons why people fear clowns:</h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>The makeup that clowns wear make them seem inhuman, and that gives the person an eerie or unsettling feeling</li>
      <li>Clowns' exaggerated facial features give people the feeling of a direct threat</li>
      <li>Clown makeup also hides most emotional signals which creates uncertainty for people</li>
      <li>The unpredictable behavior clowns convey makes people uncomfortable</li>
      <li>The biggest reason why people fear clowns most times is because of a negetive expericane they have had with a clown</li>
    </ol>

                  <p>I liked your explanation as to why clowns seem scary to some people. It's interesting how altering a person's face to seem friendly and funny can instead make it seem creepy and uncanny.</p>

            <p>This is a well written post, the content is organised and easily readable. I do think however that it could use an explanation on why the aspects of clowns (makeup, etc.) causes fear in some. I myself do not have a fear of clowns, and it's always fun to learn new things.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your insight! I will say it's really just the fact that the makeup completley morphs their face is whta freaks some people out. Other then that people are only reeally afraid of them if they've had a negetive experience with one.</p>

                <p>You got many engaged comments!  Great blog topic and choice of content. I agree with Owen that going deeper into why people fear clowns would have made this much better. Maybe a list of the five reasons? Or at least mention the "Uncanny Valley" effect: something that is almost but not quite human.  

                  Personally I suspect it has to do with the fact that clowns are both aggressive (demanding interaction, in-your-face) and smiling with big faces at the same time.  It reminds us of when we were babies and grownups would suddenly thrust their big faces into our tiny ones and smile, demanding that we react to them.</p>
