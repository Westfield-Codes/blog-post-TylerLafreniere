<h1>Do you suffer from <strong>Coulrophobia?</strong> (Fear of Clowns)</h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Why are people afraid of <strong>clowns</strong> and how do people develop <strong>Coulrophobia?</strong></h2>
  <p><em>10/15/24 by <a href="mailto:tyler200483@student-schoolsofwestfield.org">Tyler</a></em></p>
  <p>A lot of people have a fear of clowns and can cause them to have anxiety or may feel nausea and their heart will start racing the minute they are faced with the visual representation of a clown, either from a real clown in front of them or even just a picture.</p>
  <p>Coulrophobia is often caused by a negative experience from one’s childhood that involved a clown of some sort. Even if you do not have any fear of clowns at the time, when you grow up you may just develop one.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>Clowns wear makeup and other face prosthetics that alter their appearance in order to either make kids laugh at a birthday party or scare people usually during halloween. This aspect of clowns tends to be what leads to people’s hatred or fear towards clowns and what makes them seem as a direct threat.</p>
  <p>I am a fan of horror movies, and a lot of big horror and thriller movies are based on clowns. For people with Coulrophobia this of course would be a big no no, and I feel that movies like IT or The Joker have increased the number of people with this fear and made matters worse for people that had it before those movies came out.</p>
