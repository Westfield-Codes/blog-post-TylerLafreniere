<h1>Do you suffer from <strong>Coulrophobia?</strong> (Fear of Clowns)</h1>
  <hr>
  <h3>Why are people afraid of <strong>clowns</strong> and how do people develop <strong>Coulrophobia?</strong></h3>
  <p><em>10/15/24 by <a href="mailto:tyler200483@student-schoolsofwestfield.org">Tyler</a></em></p>
  <p>A lot of people have a fear of clowns and can cause them to have anxiety or may feel nausea and their heart will start racing the minute they are faced with the visual representation of a clown, either from a real clown in front of them or even just a picture.</p>
  <p>Coulrophobia is often caused by a negative experience from one’s childhood that involved a clown of some sort. Even if you do not have any fear of clowns at the time, when you grow up you may just develop one.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>What about clowns is so scary to people?</h3>
  <p>Clowns wear makeup and other face prosthetics that alter their appearance in order to either make kids laugh at a birthday party or scare people usually during halloween. This aspect of clowns tends to be what leads to people’s hatred or fear towards clowns and what makes them seem as a direct threat.</p>
  <p>I am a fan of horror movies, and a lot of big horror and thriller movies are based on clowns. For people with Coulrophobia this of course would be a big no no, and I feel that movies like 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7no56Zw1e20"><em>IT</em></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAGVQLHvwOY"><em>The Joker</em></a> have increased the number of people with this fear and made matters worse for people that had it before those movies came out.</p>

                  <p>Great stuff!  The featured image is great!  I like the two list of symptoms and also the links for extra reading!  I also like how there is not much text on the page, maybe add another subtitle after the second hr.</p>

                  <p>I liked your explanation as to why clowns seem scary to some people. It's interesting how altering a person's face to seem friendly and funny can instead make it seem creepy and uncanny.</p>

                    <p>It is kind of crazy how much even the sight of a clown can do to them and the effects it can have on their body and well-being!</p>
